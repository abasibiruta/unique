        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>To make life easy -- and fun! -- for urban and backyard chicken owners with our line of </p>
        <p>products, free information, tools and resources.</p>

        <h2>Our History</h2>

        <p>In 2004, the idea for My Pet Chicken was hatched when owner Traci Torres and her husband, Derek Sasaki, complete novices, set out to raise a few backyard chickens. After a year of reading every how-to book they could get their hands on, they successfully started their own flock, but they wanted to make it easier for aspiring chicken owners by putting free how-to information on the web and offering some unique products and services.
        
        The website, first launched in 2005, contained valuable information for backyarders, and grew to include such best-of-breed resources as the free e-book, The My Pet Chicken Guide to Chicken Care.
        
        In 2006, the Company launched a full complement of backyard chicken products and announced the sale of baby chicks in quantities as low as three: an industry first. It now boasts over 500 products for sale and ever-expanding free content, including the new Chicken Help area â€” a database of answers to chicken questions, searchable by keyword or category, and another free e-book, The My Pet Chicken Guide to Incubation and Hatching.
        
        My Pet Chicken continues to lead the way in the urban chicken space, serving tens of millions of page views per year on its web site. The media has taken notice: My Pet Chicken has been mentioned in publications ranging from The Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine, New Yorker Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, The L.A. Times, and countless others, and has appeared on such television shows as The Martha Stewart Show, Bloomberg TV, 
        ABC News Nightline, and The Today Show and made the 2012 Inc. 5000 list of fastest growing companies.
